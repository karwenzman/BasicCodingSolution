# BasicCodingSolution
VisualStudio 2022
Net 7.0
ConsoleApp
WpfApp (not startet, yet)

## Purpose
This app is meant to be a trainig application. While attending online courses, studying textbooks and performing research in stack-overflow, I do need a place to put all things together. A place where I can apply information from different sources to a simple console application.

## Goal
There are some coding patterns I want to learn (like MVVM, DependencyInjection, Logging, ...). To get used to source control and documentation are some additional goals.

## Expectation
You can expect a lot of documentation, try and error and strange attempts to solve a problem. I am a coding student - not a master. And I am trying to understand what I am doing and not just copy and paste things.

## Invitation
Fell free to post issues or to comment on them. Make sure to do this in a respectful manner, always.
